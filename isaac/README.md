# Isaac's efforts

I include the Jupyter notebooks and helper python library code for two segmentation-based challenges. I also include a few plots illustrating the output, but I do not include any of the data, the trained model savefiles, or the training logs in this repository.


- `inria`: finding the footprints of houses in the [Inria Aerial Datatset](https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/)
- `spacenet`: identifying the centerlines of roads in the [SpaceNet Roads Challenge (AOI 2)](https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/AOI_Lists/AOI_2_Vegas.html)
